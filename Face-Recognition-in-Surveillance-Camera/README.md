# Face Recognition in surveillance camera

This repository is made to save Niloofar Alizadegan's Presentation files and sources.
The ability to recognize, detect, track, extract, classify, catalog and alert on persons-of-interest appearing in video surveillance in real-time or forensically and across cameras enable situational awareness for safety, security and operational efficiency.facial  biometrics enhance security and high conversion rates.
Although deep learning approaches have achieved performance surpassing humans for still image-based face recognition,
unconstrained video-based face recognition is still a challenging task due to large volume of data to be processed and intra/inter-video
variations on pose, illumination, occlusion, scene, blur, video quality, etc. here we discuss about low resolution problems.
