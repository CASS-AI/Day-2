# An-introduction-to-geometric-deep-learning
Presenting a plan to better understand the different deep models.

## Methods and challenges that we've introduced
- Intro to neural networks
- What is the one true architecture?
- An overview on Graphs
- Go back in time (to have a comparison on different geometries)
- Inductive biases
- Invariance and Equivarince 
- Graphs in action
